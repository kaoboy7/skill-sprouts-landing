            <h1>Privacy Policy for Skill Sprouts</h1>
            
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong>  11/14/2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to Skill Sprouts! We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your family. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App") and our website, skillsprouts.co (the "Site").</p>
            <p>Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the App.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect includes:</p>

            <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect personal information via our authentication provider (Firebase Auth). This includes your email address and name as provided by you or your Google Sign-In account.</li>
                <li><strong>Child Profile Information:</strong> To personalize your experience, we ask you to provide information about your child, such as their <strong>name</strong> (or nickname) and <strong>birth date</strong>. This information is used solely to filter and recommend age-appropriate content.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., at `support@skillsprouts.co`), we may receive additional information about you, such as your name, email address, the contents of your message, and any attachments.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may use analytics services (like Firebase Analytics) to collect information about how you use our App, such as the features you use, courses you view, lessons you complete, and content you save.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Information about your mobile device, such as your device model, operating system, and unique device identifiers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>C. Information from Third Parties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> We use Firebase Auth for sign-in. When you sign in with Google, we receive a token from Google which contains your name, email address, and (if you grant permission) your profile picture. We do not receive or store your Google password.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

                <li><strong>Personalize your content:</strong> This is the core of our App. We use your child's birth date to calculate their age and show you age-appropriate courses, "Tips of the Day," and "Quotes of the Day."</li>
                <li>Process your In-App Purchases and subscription status through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</li>
